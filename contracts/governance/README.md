# Governance System

> Governance policies for the Eco currency.

The governance system of the ECO and ECOx currencies is designed to maintain and upgrade both the currencies and itself. The subfolders have their own READMEs outlining both [community](./community/README.md) and [monetary](./monetary/README.md) governance. This document describes the automation and storage machinery used to manage these processes and the generation update system.
