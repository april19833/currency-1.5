# Community Governance System

> Community governance policies for the Eco currency.

These contracts provide the community governance system for the Eco currency. They specifically address voting open to all token holders for code upgrades to the contract system. Upgrades are managed in terms of proposals which are voted on and may be executed across the span of a generation.

## Security

The security of community governance is built off of the network effect of requiring a significant percentage of token holder consensus at each step of the way. The security of balances to enforce this consensus is maintained by the checkpointing system detailed in the currency readme [here](../../currency/README.md#votecheckpoints).

## Background

The process of the Community Governance vote is set to the global Generation Cycle of 14 days. During the first phase (up to 9 days), Proposals can be submitted and users may perform a signal vote for each one. If any proposal succeeds the signal vote threshold, the initial phase ends and a voting phase immediately starts (lasting 3 days). After the voting phase is finished, there is a delay period of 1 day before enaction (if the proposal passed). There is an execution period which lasts until the end of the cycle + 1 day. If at any time during this period, the proposal is executed then the cycle is marked as done and the end time is changed back to the cycle end time. This means if the proposal is executed after the end of when the cycle would normally end, the proposing can start immediately.

_Note: the new cycle start time and end time is always calculated off of the start of the previous cycle._

## Install

See the [main README](../../../README.md) for installation instructions.

## Usage

The [CommunityGovernance](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/CommunityGovernance.md) contract handles the vote process.

All the state is managed in the CommunityGovernance contract, which contains an enum of the stages possible and rules for changing between stages.

CommunityGovernance timings are flexible. Removing the monotonic generation timer means that incrementing the generation doesnâ€™t necessarily need to happen on a specific cadence. The voting cycle can automatically renew each time a proposal passes.

Addition of getter/setter functions where necessary Permission based authorization functionality will need to be implemented in each relevant contract.

Voting ability calculation is implemented in the `VotingPower` contract. Ability to vote with ECOx is managed by the `ECOxStaking` contract. Sample proposals all follow the format of the `Proposal` contract and will not be discussed individually.

## Contract Overview

For detailed API documentation see [community](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/)

### [VotingPower](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/VotingPower.md)

- Inherits: [Policied](../../../docs/solidity/policy/Policed.md),[ECO](../../../docs/solidity/currency/ECO.md), [ECOx](../../../docs/solidity/currency/ECOx.md), [ECOxStaking](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/ECOxStaking.md)

This contract is for [CommunityGovernance](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/CommunityGovernance.md) to inherit the functionality for computing voting power for any address. The voting power calculation combines the amount of ECO in the last checkpoint before the voting process starts with the same checkpoint for qualified amounts of ECOx. Each wei of ECO has 1 voting power, and each wei ECOx has 10 voting power. These voting weights presume the initial supply of ECO is ten times bigger than the initial supply of ECOx -- meaning that at genesis, ECO and ECOx have equal contributions to total voting power. See the [currency](../../currency/README.md#votecheckpoints) documentation for more explanation about the checkpointing system and see [ECOxStaking](./README.md#ecoxstaking) in this readme to see what qualifies ECOx for voting.

#### totalVotingPower

Calculates the total Voting Power by getting the total supply of ECO
and adding total ECOX (multiplied by 10) and subtracting the excluded Voting Power

```solidity
function totalVotingPower() public view returns (uint256 total)
```

##### Return Values

| Name  | Type    | Description            |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| total | uint256 | the total Voting Power |

#### votingPower

Calculates the voting power for an address at the Snapshot Block

```solidity
function votingPower(address _who) public view returns (uint256 total)
```

##### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description                                   |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| \_who | address | the address to calculate the voting power for |

##### Return Values

| Name  | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| total | uint256 | the total vorting power for an address at the Snapshot Block |

### ECOxStaking

- Inherits: `IERC20`, [VoteCheckpoints](../../../docs/solidity/currency/VoteCheckpoints.md), [ECOx](../../../docs/solidity/currency/ECOx.md), [PolicedUpgradeable](../../../docs/solidity/policy/PolicedUpgradeable.md)

This contract is used to stake ECOx for the sake of voting with it in community governance. The quantity of EcoX locked up is the amount added to the individual's voting power. A [checkpointing system](../../currency/README.md#votecheckpoints) with delegation is used that is identical to the `ECO` contract. The stored ECOx (sECOx) cannot be transferred.

#### Errors

##### NoZeroECOx

error for if the constructor tries to set the ECOx address to zero

```solidity
error NoZeroECOx()
```

##### NonTransferrable

error for if any transfer function is attempted to be used

```solidity
error NonTransferrable()
```

#### Events

##### Deposit

The Deposit event indicates that ECOx has been locked up, credited
to a particular address in a particular amount.

```solidity
event Deposit(address source, uint256 amount)
```

### [CommunityGovernance](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/CommunityGovernance.md)

- Inherits: `Pausable`, [VotingPower](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/VotingPower.md), [ECOxStaking](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/ECOxStaking.md), [Proposal](../../../docs/solidity/governance/community/proposals/Proposal.md)

CommunityGovernance manages the stages, proposals, and voting of the community governance contract.

- This removes the need for cloning and rebinding that happen each generation and during the generation increment. Instead, all the state is managed in the CommunityGovernance contract, which contains an enum of the stages possible and rules for changing between stages.
- CommunityGovernance timings are flexible.
  - Removing the monotonic generation timer means that incrementing the generation doesnâ€™t necessarily need to happen on a specific cadence. The voting cycle can automatically renew each time a proposal passes.
- Addition of getter/setter functions where necessary
  - Permission based authorization functionality will need to be implemented in each relevant contract.

| \_pauser | address | the new pauser |

##### pause

Pauses community governance

```solidity
function pause() external
```

##### updateStage

updates the current stage
called by methods propose, vote, and execute.

```solidity
function updateStage() public
```

##### nextCycle

moves community governance to the next cycle

```solidity
function nextCycle() internal
```

##### propose

allows a user to submit a community governance proposal

Register a new proposal for community review. Registration is necessary but does not guarantee a vote for its implementation. The proposal is stored in proposals which is an array of all submissions as well as allProposals which stores the proposal addresses. A Register event is emitted.

Registering a proposal requires a deposit of 1000 ECO (COST_REGISTER), which is transferred from the caller's balance to this contract. An allowance for this transfer must be made before calling. If the proposal does not get voted on then the caller will be entitled to claim a refund of 800 ECO (REFUND_IF_LOST). If the Circuit Breaker is enacted, this registration fee is waived as transfers cannot be made. This will confuse the refund function, but that is deprioritized in the case of a circuit breaker emergency.

**Security Notes**

- Can only be called during the proposing period.
- Requires creating an allowance for payment to call to prevent abuse.
- You cannot propose the 0 address.
- A proposal can only be registered once, regardless of proposer.

```solidity
function propose(contract Proposal _proposal) public
```

###### Parameters

| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \_proposal | contract Proposal | the address of the deployed proposal fee is only levied if community governance is paused - we want to still be usable in the event that ECO transfers are paused. |
