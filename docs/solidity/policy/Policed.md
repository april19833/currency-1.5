# Policed



> Policed Contracts A policed contract is any contract managed by a policy.





## Methods

### implementation

```solidity
function implementation() external view returns (address _impl)
```

Get the address of the proxy target contract.




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _impl | address | undefined |

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address _self) external nonpayable
```

Storage initialization of cloned contract This is used to initialize the storage of the forwarded contract, and should (typically) copy or repeat any work that would normally be done in the constructor of the proxied contract. Implementations of ForwardTarget should override this function, and chain to super.initialize(_self).



#### Parameters

function policy() external view returns (contract Policy)
```

The address of the root policy instance overseeing this instance. This address can be used for ERC1820 lookup of other components, ERC1820 lookup of role policies, and interaction with the policy hierarchy.




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | contract Policy | undefined |



## Events

### NewPolicy

```solidity
event NewPolicy(contract Policy newPolicy, contract Policy oldPolicy)
```

emits when the policy contract is changed



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newPolicy  | contract Policy | denotes the new policy contract address |
| oldPolicy  | contract Policy | denotes the old policy contract address |
